Code Louisville Project

This is a simple travel website for my hometown of Florence, AL. It has a interactive google maps that started in the city. There is a form that redirects you to another page. It also contains a light box for the images that was created in JavaScript.  The header, navigation links, and welcome image are responsive to smaller screens. The images are also responsive.
